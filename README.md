Rules of the Game
Snakes and Ladders is a simple children’s dice game. The goal of the game is to reach the finish square (100) before anyone else.

If a player lands on the bottom of a ladder, they move to the top of the ladder. Bonus!

But, if a player lands on a snake’s head, the player moves back to the snake’s tail. Bummer!
